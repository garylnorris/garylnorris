### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So simple enough, I'm just going to follow the prompts. Why reinvent the wheel?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on just staying afloat in my classes. I also drill with the Air National Guard and during the summers I work for NASA as a Pathways Intern.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a college student again. It has been a year since I have been in classes, so a lot of the math and prior knowledge has faded.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything and everything. My knowledge is a mile wide and an inch deep, so if someone has a greater understanding of anything we are learning, I'm all ears
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I have an opinion on it... probably.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: glnorris@iastate.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have my open water scuba certification. I haven't gotten to use it near as much as I would like, but that's life.
